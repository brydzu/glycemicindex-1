# Concept
I was curious about glycemic index concept. So I decidec to grab information from the web. I fetch over 100 foods' glycemic index info and built a database to serve it on the web.

# Technology
* I used Spreadsheets and Python to get glycemic index data from web.
* I clean and trasform data with python and put them into mysql database
* Unfortunately I've lost phyton scripts. Because it was small scripts :)
* I built a web site using PHP
* I build a web site interface with jQuery and Bootstrap framework.
* I found some free images for the foods.

That's all.

# What About Now?
Now www.glycemicindex.info is gone away. I put the codes here.
