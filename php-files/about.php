      <h5 class="card-title">How the Data was Collected?</h5>
    I searched the internet and collected glycemic index information from several websites. I clean the data, put together that data. I eliminate the commercial foods and make it true and accurate information.
    When I found different values for the same foods, I choose the highest value. 
    Glycemic index values may change from source to source. It is like a refenrence data afterall.
    Please check any other source if you hesitate. You can connect with me also.
